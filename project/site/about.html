		<h3>ABOUT ME</h3>
		
		<p1>
			My name is Yana Belcher (Huseva), I was born in Dnepropetrovsk, Ukraine and have shown a great love for art since my childhood. It was at the age of 5 that I first decided I wanted to be an architect.  14 years later, I graduated from the Dnepropetrovsk Assembly Technikum and went on to continue my education at the Prydniprovska State Academy of Civil Engineering and Architecture. While in school, I worked at a small architectural firm in my hometown, participating in several projects throughout the city.
			<br>
			<br>
			In 2018, I migrated to America and began to paint. I work in diverse styles and techniques, using oils, watercolors, and acrylics for painting as well as pencils, pastels, pens, and crayons for my drawings. I often like to mix different materials and textures in my pieces to make each one wholly unique.
