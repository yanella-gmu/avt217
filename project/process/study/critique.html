			<h1>Portfolio Website Critique</h1>
			<p1>I looked through several web portfolios for graphic designers and artists to find the best way to showcase my work.</p1>

			<h2>Zaria Forman</h2>
			<p><img src="zaria.jpg" alt="Zaria Forman"></p>
			<p>This portfolio has a simple structure and is easy to navigate. I love that the home page is locked; you cannot scroll down. All you see on the home page is a high-quality photo of the artist and her work, as well as a simple and straightforward navigation menu at the top. Everything is well organized, and nothing distracts the viewer from the art, which is the main goal of a web portfolio.</p>

			<h2>Ricky Leungart</h2>
			<p><img src="ricky.jpg" alt="Ricky Leungart"></p>
			<p>The home page of this web portfolio is an illustration gallery with a simple navigation menu on the left. I love that the background is white, and the design is simple, so nothing distracts the viewer from the art. I also like the animated logo in the upper left corner above the menu, it adds little extra touch of creativity.</p>

			<h2>Melanie Daveid</h2>
			<p><img src="melanie.jpg" alt="Melanie Daveid"></p>
			<p>This web portfolio has dramatic, bold color scheme. I love that there is a lot of negative space on the home page, so the focus is on the logo (illustration). The navigation menu is simple and easy to use. This web portfolio is essentially a single page, and the viewer can navigate the menu by scrolling or clicking the navigation menu, which will automatically scroll to the desired location. I also like the animated logo at the bottom of the page, which echoes the illustration at the beginning.</p>

			<h2>Lotta Nieminen</h2>
			<p><img src="lotta.jpg" alt="Lotta Nieminen"></p>
			<p>A simple, modern web portfolio that blends well with the artist's style. This web portfolio has a simple repeating organization pattern and is easy to navigate. The monochrome color scheme of the web portfolio is very clear and does not distract the viewer.</p>

			<h2>Loish</h2>
			<p><img src="loish.jpg" alt="Loish"></p>
			<p>The homepage starts with an animated gallery that features the artist's work on a large scale, so the focus is on the artwork. On the left is a simple navigation menu with a logo in the top left corner. Because the work of this artist is so bright and colorful that it works best on a plain white background. The categories in the menu are well organized and easy to navigate through the website.</p>
